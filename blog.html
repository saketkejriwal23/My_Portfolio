            <h2>Learner</h2>
            <p>At first I intended to be an animator and went to design school fully motivated to become just that. One thing led to another and 2 years went by and I was a (almost) fully fledged freelance web designer without ever planning to become one.

                This fortunate turn of events has lead me to design websites for amazing people, companies and institutions. To work with people from all over the world is very rewarding. Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Germany, India, USA and England are some of the countries I have worked with. Well not the country itself, but people living there.
                
                I have sucessfully been a freelance web designer now for a while and it has given me even more love for this work. I have worked with ad agencies, web developers, diaper makers, pension funds, furniture makers, businiess women & men, friends & family.</p>
